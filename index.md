**Multimodal AI and Robotic Systems (MARS) Lab** is led by [Prof. Jianfei Yang](https://marsyang.site/) in Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. 

MARS Lab studies **Physical AI**, focusing on how AI can enable physical systems—such as robotics, IoT, and industrial systems—to *perceive, understand, and interact with the physical world*.

Our MARS Lab embodies the open-source spirit, accelerating scientific progress through impactful libraries such as SenseFi and MM-Fi, which support multimodal foundation models. We develop AI algorithms and deploy them in real-world robotic and AIoT systems. Our research is widely recognized, with publications in top venues across AI (NeurIPS, ICLR, CVPR, ICCV, ACL, TPAMI, IJCV), robotics (ICRA, IROS), and interdisciplinary science (Cell Patterns, Briefings in Bioinformatics, CACIE).
